# UrURL - My Custom URL Shortener

UrURL is a lightweight and efficient URL shortener designed for simplicity and speed. This project was inspired by the popular system design question of designing a URL shortener and was built to showcase backend engineering skills, focusing on scalability, caching strategies, and clean API design.

## Features

- **Fast URL Redirection**: Quickly redirects users from short links to their original destinations.
- **Click Tracking**: Tracks and updates click counts for each short URL in real-time.
- **Database Integration**: Uses a robust relational database for data persistence.
- **Caching for Performance**: Leverages Redis caching to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Minimalistic Frontend**: A lightweight yet aesthetically pleasing frontend built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: Vite + React with Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Relational database with optimized schema design
- **Caching**: Redis for improved performance
- **Hosting**: Self-hosted using Proxmox with a dedicated reverse proxy for secure traffic handling

## Project Goals

UrURL was designed to demonstrate:

- Clean and maintainable code with a focus on backend development
- Efficient caching strategies for high-performance web applications
- Practical use of containerized environments (Proxmox)
- Thoughtful integration of frontend design for enhanced user experience

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced analytics for URL performance insights
- Improved admin interface for better URL management
